Real Estate Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline to predict real estate prices based on a variety of features (e.g. location, size, amenities). The core work is performed in a Jupyter notebook, supported by a Python script for model training / inference.

🧾 Project Summary

Objective: Predict housing / real estate prices using machine learning models

Approach:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering, encoding)

Model training (e.g. linear models, tree models)

Model evaluation (metrics like RMSE, MAE, R²)

Inference / deployment via Script.py

🔧 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/houcem24/Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-prices-in-the-Real-Estate-Market.git
cd Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-prices-in-the-Real-Estate-Market


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
Jupyter Notebook

Open and run Notebook.ipynb step by step to explore data, build models, and visualize results.

Script for Training / Prediction

Use Script.py to train models or make price predictions from new input data. Adjust paths or parameters inside as needed.

📊 Evaluation & Results

Common regression metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² are used to evaluate model performance

Visualizations (residual plots, feature importance, correlation heatmaps) help interpret results

⚠️ Notes & Tips

Make sure your dataset file paths and names match what’s referenced in the notebook and script

When applying to new data, ensure features are preprocessed exactly as in the training pipeline

You can extend the model set, perform hyperparameter tuning, or try ensemble methods
